## @package install Contains the base files for a lodel2 instance
#
# An instance is composed of multiple things :
#- a configuration directory ( @ref install/conf.d/ )
#- a bootstraping script ( @ref install/loader.py )
#- an utilities source code ( @ref install/lodel_admin.py )
#- a Makefile that allow to run common instance operations (only refresh the dynamic code for now)
